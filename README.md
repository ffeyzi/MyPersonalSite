# MyPersonalSite

This is my personal site. It was developed using only HTML and CSS. I made this site while learning how to write HTML/CSS. The color scheme was selected from flatuicolors.co. The site is also 100% responsive, so if you're using a tablet or mobile phone, the site will be adjusted to your screen. 

As with any project, there was a lot of trial and error. I hope you like the site. If you have any feedback, please let me know. Also! As I continue learning, I'll update this site and change the features/design. For now, I think it does the job!

Best, Fred
